## Introduction
The PPG Project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline for analyzing physiological data to detect anxiety levels. 

This documentation outlines the workflow, from raw data collection to model evaluation, providing detailed explanations for each step and the scripts involved.

## PPG Overview
### What is PPG?
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical method to measure blood volume changes in the skin. It monitors heart rate and blood oxygen (SpO2) levels.

### How PPG Works
1. **Light Emission:** An LED shines light into the skin.
2. **Absorption and Reflection:** Blood absorbs light, and the rest is reflected back.
3. **Detection:** A sensor measures the reflected light.
4. **Blood Volume Changes:** With each heartbeat, blood volume changes, altering light absorption.
5. **Signal Generation:** The sensor converts light changes into an electrical signal (PPG waveform).
6. **Data Analysis:** The PPG signal is analyzed to determine heart rate and blood oxygen levels (SpO2).

### Key Points
- **Heart Rate Monitoring:** Detects heartbeats to calculate heart rate.
- **SpO2 Monitoring:** Uses dual-wavelength light to estimate blood oxygen levels.
- **Non-Invasive:** Suitable for continuous use in wearables like fitness trackers and smartwatches.

## HRV Analysis
### What is HRV?
Heart Rate Variability (HRV) of a PPG (Photoplethysmogram) signal is the measurement of the variation in time intervals between successive pulse peaks reflecting the heartbeats. HRV provides insights into autonomic nervous system function and cardiovascular health.

### Why Measure HRV?
1. **Cardiovascular Health:** Higher HRV indicates better cardiovascular health and resilience.
2. **Stress and Recovery Monitoring:** Tracks stress levels and recovery in everyday life and athletic training.
3. **Mental Health Monitoring:** Lower HRV is associated with anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions.
4. **Early Health Warnings:** Changes in HRV can provide early warnings of potential health issues.
5. **Chronic Condition Management:** Useful in managing conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.
6. **Research and Clinical Studies:** Widely used to study the ANS and its impact on various physiological and pathological conditions.

### HRV Metrics
Here are some examples of HRV metrics which one can get from any body signal.
#### Time-Domain HRV Metrics
- **MeanNN:** The average length of the intervals between normal heartbeats.
- **SDNN:** Standard deviation of the NN intervals.
- **RMSSD:** Square root of the mean squared differences between successive NN intervals.
- **pNN50:** The proportion of successive NN intervals that differ by more than 50 milliseconds.

#### Frequency-Domain HRV Metrics
- **LF (Low Frequency):** Represents the power in the low-frequency range (0.04–0.15 Hz).
- **HF (High Frequency):** Represents the power in the high-frequency range (0.15–0.4 Hz).
- **LF/HF Ratio:** Provides insights into the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activities.

## Data Collection

We conducted a survey to collect PPG data from 101 participants, capturing their PPG time series data during various activities. This project specifically uses `activity1` data from all participants.

### Raw Data
- **Directory:** `Raw`
  - **Subdirectory:** `GSR_data`
    - **Description:** Contains directories for each participant (e.g., `101_GSR`, `102_GSR`), with each directory holding CSV files for different activities. For this project, we are using the `activity.csv` file from each participant's directory.
